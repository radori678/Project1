Raleigh is the capital of North Carolina, and is the metropolitan area
where I was raised. I chose Raleigh because of my familiarity with the area
and my curiosity as to how complete the OSM data was in regard to the city.
Raleigh is mostly suburban, with a small downtown region and is part of a larger
“Research Triangle” area composing of the cities Raleigh and Durham, and the
towns of Cary and Chapel Hill.
