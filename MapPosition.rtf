Raleigh is the capital of North Carolina, and is the metropolitan area where I was raised. I chose Raleigh because of my familiarity with the area and my curiosity as to how complete the OSM data was in regard to the city. Raleigh is mostly suburban, with a small downtown region and is part of a larger \'93Research Triangle\'94 area composing of the cities Raleigh and Durham, and the towns of Cary and Chapel Hill}
