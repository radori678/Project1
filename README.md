Data Analyst Project 3: Data Wrangling with MongoDB
Analyzed an OpenStreetMap (OSM) section of the world (Raleigh).
Extracted the file and converted from xml into json in Python.
Used MongoDB (PyMongo) to run queries and aggregation pipelines to gain further understanding of the data, 
including zipcodes, street names, and housenumbers.
AFterwards, edited my Python conversion code to amend and audit the Raleigh OSM data to produce a final, cleaned version.
